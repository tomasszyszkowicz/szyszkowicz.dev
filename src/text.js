	"I'm a speedcuber since 2016. Since then i attended 24 competitions. During this time I broke national record 5 times and won 29 medals. 2 of them are gold. 12 of them are silver and 15 are bronze. My personal best in 3x3x3 is 6.72, which I got in 2017. Currently the best result I have is a 38.00 megaminx single which places me 67th in Europe. I don't cube as much as I used to, but I still enjoy it, and I still belong to the top of cz/sk cubers. On the last National Championship I won 4 medals in 4 different categories. What I like the most about cubing is the competitivness I have with myself. I always try to beat my personal bests.";

	'I\'m a big fan of video games and have been playing them since I was a little kid. Initially, I enjoyed single-player games, but as I grew older, I started to appreciate the competitive aspect of multiplayer games. Since 2017, I\'ve been playing games like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Valorant, Trackmania, and Fortnite. I really enjoy the process of learning different mechanics and strategies in these games. While I mostly prefer playing these games alone, I sometimes play with friends. My biggest achievements include reaching the highest rank in CS and placing 70th in the Trackmania event called "Kacky." I also love watching professional CS matches. My favorite teams are Faze, Mousesports, and G2 Esports, and my favorite player is David "frozen" Čerňanský. I like him because he is a young, talented player with a lot of potential.';
